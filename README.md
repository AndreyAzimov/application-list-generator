# Application List Generator

## A series of scripts to generate lists of top companies to target in the job hunt.

## Some of the biggest hurdles in the job search can be eliminated by generating a pre-vetted list of companies. Think of this as a To-Do list for job applications. Eliminate the indecision and the cognitive load of deciding where to apply next.

## Visit one of your favorite sites for searching company profiles and open positions.
## Open your browser's developer console.
## Copy/paste and run the appropriate script into the console.
## The resulting string is a list of comma-separated values.

## Copy/paste the resulting string into a spreadsheet cell.
## Split the cell data into column headers.
## Copy/paste transposed the column headers into a single column.

## Recommended: Select all of the company names and randomize the range.
